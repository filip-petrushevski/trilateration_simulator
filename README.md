# Trilateration simulator
This is a homework project for faculty subject - Sensor Systems

Note: 
The homework's main focus is not the code and therefore this project is not an example of well written object-oriented code. 
In a big part it violates many of the clean code principles and there is a huge percent of code duplication. 
It will be improved in the future. 
If you are willing to contribute and refactor the code, feel free to fork and make a pull request. I will be more than happy to approve any improvement/refactoring of the code.
