# Trilateration simulator
This is a homework project for faculty subject - Sensor Systems
  
Note: 
The homework's main focus is not the code and therefore this project is not an example of well written object-oriented code. 
In a big part it violates many of the clean code principles and there is a huge percent of code duplication. 
It will be improved in the future. 
If you are willing to contribute and refactor the code, feel free to fork and make a pull request. I will be more than happy to approve any improvement/refactoring of the code.
  
Important Note:  
While executing the simulator if you come across _TooManyEvaluationsException: illegal state: maximal count (1,000) exceeded: evaluations_, just run the program again. It's an exception thrown by a function from an external library and therefore I cannot fix it.
